# WorldSim

The goal of this project is to simulate a procedurally generated world. It currently simulates simple evaporation and precipitation, a shallow water model, thermal and hydraulic erosion, and (terribly) plate tectonics.

Library dependancies: SDL2, OpenCL, OpenGL, Mathias Brossard's threadpool library, David Blackman and Sebastiano Vigna's xoroshiro128+ library

This is very much a work in progress. Building can be done by running make in the source directory.
